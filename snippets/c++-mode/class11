# desc: Snippet for C++11 classes based on c++-mode/class. Allows for Rule of
# [0, All]. A choice between ";", " = default;", and " = delete;" is presented
# for each method. The methods and some of the optional keywords/specifiers are
# exposed as fields that users can easily skip-and-clear.
# Hackish query-replace-regexp to renumber non-mirror fields in the region
# between public and protected (can use N as a field number in the snippet):
# \${[0-9N]*:\([^\$]\) -> ${\,(+ 2 \#):\1
